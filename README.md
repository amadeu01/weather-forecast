## iOS Test Task

> As a part of the recruitment process at Volvo Cars we ask you to complete
> this coding assignment. The task has been kept simple and open, allowing
> for you (as the candidate) to put focus not only on the technical parts of
> the solution, but also on style, readability and maintainability. Please solve
> this assignment in the same fashion had you been given it as an employee,
> with real live users as the target audience in mind. That said, we do not
> want you to spend more than a day on this assignment.

## Further Details 

Complete the task using UIKit and/or SwiftUI. A completed task consists
of a runnable iOS application.

## üõ† How to run?

This project is using [tuist](https://github.com/tuist/tuist) to manage the xcode project generation and to help with the modularization of the project.
Moreover, it is also using [carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) due to one dependency, be sure to install as well.

Before running the project we have to generate the xcode project.

### üèó How to generate the project?

First, be sure you have tuist installed on your environment.
The recommended way, is to run the following command:

```bash

```

After successfully install tuist, you can run the following command

```bash
tuist generate
```

**OBS:** You might have to download the dependencies 

```bash
tuist dependencies fetch
```

## How to edit the project settings?

Just use tuist with the following command

```bash
tuist edit
```

Then, change the configuration.

## Points to evolve the project

- [ ] Write more tests
- [ ] Write UI tests
- [ ] Fix previews for each views
- [ ] Use the GenreView and the MoodView when needed
- [ ] Improve the routing/navigation


## Generate Dependencies Graph?

You can use tuist to generate a graph
